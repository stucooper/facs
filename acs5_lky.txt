These are the Actual Crown Scandals.

5) FAMOUS WEALTHY ASIAN REFUSES ENTRY TO GAMING FLOOR

The photo shows perhaps the greatest South-East Asian of
the 20th Century, Lee Kuan Yew. In the early 2000s, LKY
visited Melbourne in his role as Singapore's Senior
Minister and stayed at the 5-Star Crown Towers Hotel.

But he refused to step onto the gaming floor, instead walking
around the public shops on the periphery. What did Crown do to
make this giant of Asian politics feel so unwelcome?

Absolutely nothing. LKY doesn't like gambling. I used to joke
that I somehow married the only Chinese person in all of Asia who
didn't like gambling. How wrong I was. My wife wasn't even the
only Singaporean who didn't like gambling. It turns out there's
millions of Chinese who don't like gambling. They're the ones
you don't see in Casinos.

Before Linus joined our family, my wife and I considered a visit
to the Northern NSW town of Casino, my brother Grahame
managed a pub there in those days. "You'd better give it a miss,
Stuart" Grahame told me. "My regulars are all country rednecks and
they won't like the look of Eu Lin".

"Wow!" one of my Hong Kong Chinese friends exclaimed when I
told him this story. "That must be the only Casino on Earth
that doesn't welcome Asians".
