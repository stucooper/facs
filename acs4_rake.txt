ACTUAL CROWN SCANDALS

These are the Actual Crown Scandals.

4) $9 RAKE TAKEN FROM $89 POKER POT

In cash poker, the players play against each other. The casino dealer
doesn't care who wins the pot and the house never loses. The casino
takes a cut of each cash pot, called The Rake. In 2010, the amount
of the rake for each pot was 10% of the pot, rounded down, to a maximum
of $10.

You don't need Linus Maths to calulate the rake. If you win a $48 pot,
the casino keeps $4 of it and you get $44. If you win a $143 pot, the
casino keeps their maximum take of $10 and you get pushed the remaining
$133. It's Poker etiquette to say "Send it" to the dealer before he pushes
you the pot, but even if you don't the Maths is still the same. It's simple
Maths.

Or not so simple, for the Yarra-River based Melbourne gambling juggernaut.
In December 2010 I won an $89 pot and was passed $80, the Casino keeping
$9. Now as you can see, the Casino rake for an $89 pot is $8 and they'd
taken an extra $1 to which they weren't entitled. I quickly corrected
the dealer and he passed me back my rightful $1.

A supervisor was standing nearby so I left the table and had a quiet
word to him. He gave me a mealy-mouthed excuse that Dealers are human
too and while accuracy is always their primary focus, they also need
to deal quickly and efficiently. I mentioned Independent MP Andrew
Wilkie and the supervisor's face turned pale.
