ACTUAL CROWN SCANDALS

No Ben Simmons (BS), No 60 Minutes, No Nine Newspapers.
These are the Actual Crown Scandals.

9) ANTANAS GUOGA

Poker fans worldwide will recognise Australia's
best-known poker export, Tony G, but few will know his
former name Antanas Guoga and the disgraceful
role Crown Casino played in his change of identity.

When you walk into a casino to play Cash poker, you typically
don't get seated straight away. You have to join a waiting list
and wait for a seat to become available, either by players leaving
a game or by a new table starting. First come, first served. The
waiting lists of registered players waiting for their seats are shown
on a few big screens in the poker area.

But are these screens big enough? No. There are five columns of waiting
lists shown, and your name can't be too wide to fit in these columns.
The name JOE HACHEM fits but ANTANAS GUOGA was too wide for Crown's
computer systems, so he signed in simply as TONY G.

After just a few weeks of this, G's former name fell into disuse
and died off. G, who has Lithuanian heritage, is now known
only through his foreshortened Crown signin name. I
remind Crown that Australian Law forbids Racial
Discrimination and takes a very dim view of people
from the Baltic States being discriminated against.
I notice that almost no Chinese names would
need shortening. The system seems designed to benefit
Chinese players and discriminate against Thais, Indians and Europeans.

Nobody know the full effect that having to adopt a new identity
has had on G, but some commentators believe his abrasive personality is
a reaction to his shameful treatment at the hands of Crown's
registration systems.
