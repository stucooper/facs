ACTUAL CROWN SCANDALS

No Ben Simmons (BS), No 60 Minutes, No Nine Newspapers.
These are the Actual Crown Scandals.

3) $200 MAXIMUM WITHDRAWAL ATMS

I didn't mis-type the headline. At Crown Casino, there is a row of
Automated Teller Machines with a daily maximum withdrawal limit of
Two Hundred Dollars.

Nowadays people pay for just about everything with tap and wave
credit cards or debit cards. Mortgage Offset Accounts and long
Interest-Free periods on Credit Cards mean you don't have to carry a lot
of cash on your person these days. But in a Casino, Cash is still King.

The Crown Poker Room is on the West side of the complex, closest
to Southern Cross Station. The ATMs at that side of the Casino,
last time I was there, have a $200 daily Withdrawal Limit.

What can you buy for $200 these days? Not much. You don't have
to party like a rock star for dinner and drinks to cost well over
$200. And you can't play any level of Casino game for any useful
amount of time for that amount.

Those $200 ATMs charge you the full $2.50 non-bank usage fee; so
you're paying a rapacious 1.25% operator fee on your useless withdrawal.

There are proper non-crippled ATMs on the other side of the Crown complex; but
the Crown complex is huge. It's the size of seventy football fields. That's
bad enough already but remember this is Melbourne so a football field
is an Aussie Rules football field which is much bigger than a rectangular
football field. You have to walk through seventy MCGs of casino space, just
to get at your own money at a withdrawal limit that you've set yourself.
