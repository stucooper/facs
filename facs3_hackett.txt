FURTHER ACTUAL CROWN SCANDALS (FACS)

For FACS sake, when will the scandals ever end??

3) GRANT HACKETT LOSES HIS SHIRT

You don't see it in the TV ads and the marketing, but of
course anyone who goes into a Casino can lose and lose big.
As you're going in for your fun, there's a separate stream
of players leaving for the day; and many of them have lost
and some of them have had a very bad day, gone over their limits
and lost their shirts.

While Australian society is very egalitarian and we normally
frown on public figures getting special treatment, there's still
a place for discretion and understanding. If a well-known
person, likely to attract media coverage, has had a tough day
and lost their shirt, the least Crown can do is provide that
person with a shirt so that he or she can exit the premises
with dignity. The player returns the shirt with
their next visit, and is expected though not required
to have cleaned the shirt since wearing it.

In 2014, Australian Olympic Swimming legend Grant Hackett lost his
shirt and his 4-year old son in a visit to Crown. Crown shouldn't have
let him gamble with his son, even in the High Stakes Mahogany Room, which
like all gaming areas is restricted to patrons over the age of
18 years. Table Stakes.

Australian schoolkids are taught as part of Safety at the Beach
to beware of dangerous animals that are far faster in the water
than they look: Sharks, Grant Hackett and Salt Water Crocodiles.
You can't outrun any of them no matter how strong a swimmer you are.
