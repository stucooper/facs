ACTUAL CROWN SCANDALS

These are the Actual Crown Scandals.

2) $165,000 POKER TOURNAMENT PRIZE PAID IN CASH CHIPS

chips belonged to him. Sure they did, Jonathan.

In the mid 2000s, a friend of mine came 6th in the Aussie Millions
Main Event. For his efforts he received around $165,000. The final
table was played in a special players-only TV studio, away from
the public gaming area. Crown paid him his prize in cash chips,
which he then had to carry unescorted back onto the
gaming floor (seventy football fields, and Aussie Rules sized
football fields) to the main cashier to have changed into a cheque.

When you walk across a casino gaming floor you walk past many table
games of small, medium, large and massive betting limits. My
friend could have sat down with his newly acquired $25,000 plaques and played
$1000 blackjack against the house, no questions asked. Indeed, by paying
him this way, it seems Crown were hoping he'd do exactly this.

Other casinos present tournament winners with printed receipts
which they exchange for a cheque at the main cashier. I trust
Crown have since adopted this way of paying large tournament prizes.
