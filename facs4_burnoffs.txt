FURTHER ACTUAL CROWN SCANDALS (FACS)

For FACS sake, when will the scandals ever end??

4) HOT SMELLY LOUD WASTEFUL FUEL BURNOFFS

I'm the last person you'd think of as a Greenie. If people
are doing burnouts in their cars or wasting single-use plastics,
go for it. I'm pissed that supermarkets don't give you free throwaway
plastic bags anymore. But the fuel burnoffs on the Southbank of the
Yarra River at Crown are hot, smelly, loud and wasteful.

Many casinos have a "wishing well" at their entrance where you
can drop coins or even banknotes on your way in, in a hope you'll
bring yourself good luck. The Star at Sydney have an ingenious
staircase wishing-pool which you can donate to at any stage
of your escalator ride up to the gaming floor. But Crown just
have exploding timed jets of flame. They're like those swimming
fountains kids run around in, except instead of fun bursts
of water they shoot up dangerous jets of flame. These flames are
too hot and dangerous to throw your cash into; which is a shame
because literally burning real cash immediately before entering
a Casino is an idea that really appeals to me.

There are, of course, good uses for public flames. The Eternal Flames
at war memorials are a solemn symbol of our eternal gratitude
and remembrance of our war dead. But the flames at Southbank
just symbolise a primitive love of fire and destruction
akin to Burning Man festivals, Nazi rallies or Wagner operas.

Following Crown's lead, public sports have introduced flame
throwers to try to drum up excitement; including Twenty/20
BigBash, Rugby League and AFL matches. Cricketer
Aaron Finch was almost incinerated at the Adelaide Oval in 2014
when a flame thrower on the boundary went off a metre from where
he was fielding the ball.

If you want to see fuel burnoffs, drive to a refinery and
watch from a safe distance. You shouldn't be subjected
to it at Crown.
