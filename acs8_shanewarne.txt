ACTUAL CROWN SCANDALS

No Ben Simmons (BS), No 60 Minutes, No Nine Newspapers.
These are the Actual Crown Scandals.

8) SHANE WARNED OFF TEXTING

No Australian sportsman has done more for Poker in Australia
than Shane Warne. His now defunct charity, The Shane Warne
Foundation, ran Charity Poker tournaments at Crown and
for many people Warne and Joe Hachem were the faces of Crown Poker.

And how did Crown Casino thank Australia's greatest wicket
taker? By giving him repeated penalties for texting at the
table during poker tournaments.

As you might imagine poker players aren't allowed to send
text messages when involved in poker hands. They could
potentially be sharing information about their cards with
each other ( I've got Ks9c LOL. I'm raising Ah6h OMG). However,
if only one player in the entire poker area is allowed to SMS,
this wouldn't be a problem. That player should
be Shane Warne.

There's a precedent in the game Roulette. In Roulette,
players are given different coloured chips so their bets are
separately identifiable, but one and only one player at the
table can bet with Cash Chips.

Shane's had a lot of false starts in his love life, and he
continues his search for The One. By allowing Shane, and only Shane,
to text in the poker area; he can continue to support Crown's
Poker Tournaments and continue his quest for True Romance.
The Melbourne Herald Sun surveyed 1000 single women in Melbourne
in 2014 and asked them "would you go out with Shane Warne?"
and 73% said "Never again" but 23% said they'd give him another
chance and a surprisingly high 4% had never been out with him before.

I wish Shane good luck in his search and wish Crown could accommodate
his needs.
