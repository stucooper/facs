ACTUAL CROWN SCANDALS

No Ben Simmons (BS), No 60 Minutes, No Nine Newspapers.
These are the Actual Crown Scandals.

7) PHIL IVEY ASKED FOR ID

The most recognized player in poker for the last 20 years is Phil Ivey.
He's often called The Tiger Woods of Poker; both share African
American heritage (Wood's mother is Thai) and both have had enormous
success in their sports. Ivey's had a lot of success at Crown Casino,
but that didn't stop him being asked for ID one year during the
Aussie Millions series.

This was a bit different to the Ben Simmons affair. Ivey was already
in the poker area and was asked to show his ID to prove he was a
poker player not a spectator. Security were enforcing strict separation
between players and spectators at the time.

Amusingly, two metres behind Ivey was an enormous photo of him playing
poker in Crown's poker room. The incident was akin to a Wimbledon official
asking Roger Federer to produce his player's pass.

Ivey took the ID request in good spirits and produced his identification,
which showed that he came from New Jersey in the USA and that his real
name is actually Jerome.
