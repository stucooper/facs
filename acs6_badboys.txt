ACTUAL CROWN SCANDALS

No Ben Simmons (BS), No 60 Minutes, No Nine Newspapers.
These are the Actual Crown Scandals.

6) RING-INS AT BAD BOYS OF POKER INVITATIONAL

Everyone remembers the Fine Cotton Ring-In scandal, where a horse
was substituted for another horse and a betting plunge was uncovered.
You'd think these scandals would be impossible at Crown Casino.
You're wrong. Here, for the first time, is the story of Ring-Ins
in a $10,000 Crown Casino 10-player Restricted tournament.

Most Poker games are open to anyone who stumps up the buyin but
a few are Restricted. In 2007 Crown Casino ran a special
single table game, the 10-player Bad Boys Of Poker Invitational.

The game featured the likes of Gary Benson, Tony G, David Saab
(who turned out to be the Baddest of them all), Jeff Lisandro,
Mark Vos, Billy The Croc, Lee Nelson and Sam Khouiss. So far so Bad.
You don't mess with those guys.

However, scandalously, also in the group were Young-Gun Melbourne
stars Emad Tahtouh and Arul Thillai. These are two of the
smartest and nicest people you could meet, at or away from the
tables. With due respect to their families, nobody could
ever call Emad or Arul Bad, or even Misbehaved. They've been accused
of bringing the game of Poker into repute. If you get lucky in a big pot
against Arul, you're afraid he'll ask you to meet him outside
so he can join you for dinner and ask about your family and whether he
can help you with your poker.

The game was won by Benson, with Arul second and Emad third, proving
the old saying that Nice Guys finish second and third in poker.
