FURTHER ACTUAL CROWN SCANDALS

Early this month, responding to 60 Minutes/Nine Newspapers
Crown Casino reports and the Ben Simmons BS affair, I published
on Facebook a 10-part series of ACTUAL CROWN SCANDALS.

The series generated a phenomenal response. One of the scandals
got 2 comments, 3 likes and a "shocked face" reaction. This is by far
the best engagement of any of my Facebook posts.

Giddy with success, I'm flogging a dead horse and today I
announce a further series of Crown Casino scandals.
I've scraped the bottom of the barrel and come up
with the FURTHER ACTUAL CROWN SCANDALS, the FACS.

You don't want 60 Minutes/Newspaper sensationalist reporting,
you want the FACS. You don't want Crown Corporate Full Page
Newspaper ads, you want the FACS. When you read
this new series, you'll think "For FACS Sake, when
will the scandals ever end??"

Keep watching the best profile on all of Facebook for
the FACS.
