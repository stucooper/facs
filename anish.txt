Amazingly Crown are still doing this in 2020.
A poker pal of mine, Anish Kumar, made just under $30,000 in coming third
in a $1150 buyin game, and posted a picture of chips to the value
of $29,480 on his Facebook. I replied to that picture with a comment.

STUART: Great work. Are Crown still paying out with Cash Chips and
forcing winners to walk across the gaming floor (past high stakes
gaming tables) to get cheques or cash for their poker winnings???
In 2020, this behaviour is bizarre.

ANISH: Yeah they are lol clever tactic of theirs.
