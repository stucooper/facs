FURTHER ACTUAL CROWN SCANDALS (FACS)

For FACS sake, when will the scandals ever end??

2) FEV FORCED TO FLEE AT THE BROWNLOW

Brendan Fevola, "Fev", is one of the most loved AFL players
of recent times. In the days before Instagram, he was one of
the top ten sources of racy pictures of Lara Bingle. He
was a popular full forward for the Carlton Blues and then
the Brisbane Lions and played country football for years
after his AFL days ended.

He also liked a bet, perhaps too much for his own good. He
was once removed from the Crown Poker room, trying to play
Texas Holdem poker against just the Dealer. But it was Crown
letting him down at the 2009 Brownlow that is the scandal here.

The Brownlow Medal is AFL's night-of-nights and is held each year
at the Crown Palladium Ballroom. It's a night that all AFL
fans watch keenly.

It is also interminable. You have to listen to Andrew Demetriou or
Gillon McLachlan or whoever the AFL chief is at the time
read out 3-2-1 votes for a hundred and ninety plus games. It's so
boring it makes an Academy Awards night look like a fast-paced
thriller.

In 2009, this all got a bit too much for Fev and he made an exit from
the Ballroom to get in a few hands of Blackjack. But surely Crown could've
had a discreet mobile Blackjack table set up inside the Ballroom to
accomodate his needs?

Now obviously a mobile Blackjack table isn't appropriate for every
function at the Crown Palladium. It might not be required for
cricket's night-of-nights the Allan Border Medal; especially with
Shane Warne long since retired. Warne learned more than just the
art of leg-spin from his mentor Terry Jenner. But Brownlow
Night is a function full of AFL Footballers. A little commonsense
on Crown's part would go a long way to avoiding player
embarrassment.
