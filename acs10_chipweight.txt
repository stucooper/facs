ACTUAL CROWN SCANDALS

After the sensationalism of 60 Minutes/Nine Newspapers (Age, SMH) Crown
"scandals" and the Ben Simmons (BS) racial profiling
"scandal", I will be presenting, through this and my next nine Facebook updates,
a series of Actual Crown Scandals.

I have experienced each scandal first hand, some of them will be
supported from newspaper articles I wrote in 2010 and 2011.
For actual, genuine, scandals of Crown, keep watching the most
entertaining Facebook profile you know of, this one.

10) THE CASH CHIPS DON'T WEIGH ENOUGH

Crown chips simply aren't heavy enough. They have too much of a plastic
feel and in games involving stacks of chips; like poker, players
are given an inferior experience in handling the chips. A lot of
casinos use lighter tournament chips (No Cash Value) but Crown
is unique among Australian Casinos in using lightweight cash chips. These
chips are also used in table games like Roulette and Blackjack, so
players of house games are also disadvantaged by Crown's chips.

Legend of Poker Doyle Brunson says that to play No Limit Poker, "you need
a strong right arm" (to push your chips in). Not at Crown you don't.
