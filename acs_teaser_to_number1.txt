RECAP OF THE FIRST NINE ACTUAL CROWN SCANDALS

So far in the Actual Crown Scandals series we've seen Nine Scandals.
Many of these scandals were one-off events, some from ten years ago or more.
When Crown take out full-page newspaper advertisements
to address the scandals, they can rightfully say
"Fair go, Stuart, these scandals are from years ago".

Here are the scandals so far:

10) CASH CHIPS AREN'T HEAVY ENOUGH
9) ANTANAS GUGOA FORCED TO CHANGE NAME TO TONY G
8) SHANE WARNE NOT ALLOWED TO TEXT AT THE POKER TABLES
7) PHIL IVEY ASKED FOR I.D
6) SOME BAD BOYS OF POKER ENTRANTS WERE NOT ACTUALLY BAD BOYS
5) NOT ALL ASIANS LIKE GAMBLING
4) $9 RAKE TAKEN FROM $89 POT
3) $200 MAX WITHDRAWAL ATMS
2) $165,000 TOURNAMENT WIN PAID IN CASH CHIPS

The biggest and final scandal will be revealed at 830am, Friday 9 August.
I am releasing the final scandal to coincide with people's morning commute,
which for many is peak Facebook time. The #1 Scandal has been going on
for years now and is still happening today. From what I can see, Crown are
not doing enough to address this scandal. After tomorrow morning, you'll
never look at Crown the same way again.
